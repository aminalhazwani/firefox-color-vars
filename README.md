# color vars for the style guide

make changes to the json then run gulp to update the scss file

# CLR (OsX Color Lib)

Add the CLR file to '~/Library/Colors' and all of these colors will show up in your picker.

`gulp precompile` converts the json to a format that works with a CLR generator script i found here: `https://github.com/tokorom/json2clr`

to rebuild the clr script, you'll need to clone the above repo and follow instructions there.
